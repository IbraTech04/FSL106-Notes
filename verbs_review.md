Recall: Only one word :D

## Imparfait review

Recall: Only one word :D

About a habitual or continuous action in the past
Example: I was eating, I was drinking, I was sleeping

Il y a => Il y **avait**
c'est => c'**était**
> c'etait son anniversaire hier => it was his birthday yesterday
> This is habitual, hence why we use imparfait
je suis => j'**étais** (note the `s` instead of `t`)
