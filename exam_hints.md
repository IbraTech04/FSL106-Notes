placer commencer -> au imparfait

Valises

Recall: No agreement in passe composer when you add a part of body:
ex: Jem e suis brossé les dents. (No agreement)
Je me suis lavé **(e)** (agreement!)

Recall: You cannot distinguish between third person plural/singular in imparfait when the word starts with a consonant!!

recall: appeler vs telephoner
-> telephoner requires `a`, appeler does not!

Regional => Regionaux (masc, pluriel)

Embrasser => to kiss
S'embrasser => to kiss each other

Recall: Etre has no agreement iff you have motion verb + some noun after it in PC:

Ex: Elle s'est brossé les dents. (No agreement)
But: Elle s'est brossée. (Agreement)

Exception for Avoir as well:
J'ai trouvé la classe de français (no agreement)

HOWEVER:
Je **l'ai** trouvée (agreement!!) - **NOT COI!!! COD ONLY!!!**

J'ai pris les photo => Je les-ai pris**es**
> bottom line: if you have a COD, you must agree with it!

Tu m'ecoutes? => COD!
> oui, je t'ecoute!
