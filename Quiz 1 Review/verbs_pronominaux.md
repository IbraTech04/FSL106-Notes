# Quiz 1 Review: Révision des Verbes Pronominaux


Recall: Pronominaux are verbs that have a **reflexive pronoun** in front of them.
Example: Se laver, se réveiller, s'endormir, etc.

They indicate that the **subject** of the verb is also the **object** of the verb.

Example: 

Je me rase => I shave myself

## Important Notes
1. **ALL** pronominaux verbs use **être** as the auxiliary verb in the passé composé, regardless of the root verb being DR-MRS-VANDERTRAMPP or not.
