# Plural vs. Singular: How to tell them apart

Recall: In french we have `il`/`elle` (third person singular) and `ils`/`elles` (third person plural).

They *typically* have different endings, however sound the same. For example:

Il mange (he eats) vs. Ils mangent (they eat).
> Both are pronounced the same, but the first one is singular and the second one is plural. You **cannot** tell them apart **without further context clues**

## Examples

### Basic Examples

Il mange une pomme avec son ami
> Son ami (his friend) is a clue that we are talking about a singular subject!
vs. Ils mangent des pommes avec leurs amis
> Leurs amis (their friends) is a clue that we are talking about a plural subject!

### Irregular Verbs

Typically, we **cannot** differentiate between singular and plural of the third person **unless it is an irregular verb**


#### Faire

Ils **font** (they do) vs. Il **fait** (he does)
> We can differentiate it here!

#### Avoir

Il a (he has) vs. Ils ont (they have)

#### Être

Il est (he is) vs. Ils sont (they are)
> We can differentiate it here!

Tl;dr - **if it's irregular, you can differentiate. else you cannot.**

### Examples with "liason"

Recall, in french, we have "liason" (linking) where we link the last consonant of a word to the next word if it starts with a vowel. For example:
> Il est un ami (he is a friend) is pronounced as "il est-t-un ami" 

Elles aiment écouter de la musique
> We know this is plural because it's pronounced as "elles-z-aiment écouter de la musique", while in singular it would be "elle aime écouter de la musique" without the "z" sound.

Ils habitent à Paris.
> Again; Same thing. Ils-z-habitent à Paris vs. Il habite à Paris.

Ils étudient ensemble.
> Same thing. Ils-z-étudient ensemble vs. Il étudie ensemble. (though note, that last sentence doesn't really make sense.)

### Imparfait

It is harder to tell apart singular and plural in imparfait, because the endings are the same. For this; we rely on **liason** and **context clues**.
> For example: "Ils étudiaient" (they study together) vs. "Il étudiait ensemble" (he studies together). The first one is plural and the second one is singular, and we tell them apart purely by the liason (i.e: ils-z-étudient vs. il étudiait).
