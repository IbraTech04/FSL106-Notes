## How to tell apart Passé Composé and Imparfait

- Passé Composé is used for actions that are completed in the **past**. A **BOOM** action. It happened at a **set time**, and it is **done**
- Passé Composé is made up of **TWO** parts (i.e: *composé*)
  - Auxiliary verb (être or avoir) in the present tense
  - Past participle of the main verb

- Imparfait is used for actions that are ongoing or habitual in the past.
  - Imparfait is **ONE** word; it is a single verb form.
  - It is used to describe **background actions** or **ongoing actions** in the past. Also used for **memories** and **descriptions**.
  - It is used to describe **what was happening** or **what used to happen** in the past.

- All Passé Composé verbs sound the **same** (in the sense that, the only thing that changes is the aux + conjugation of the verb). For example:
  - J'ai mangé (I ate)
  - Tu as mangé (You ate)
  - Il a mangé (He ate)
  - Nous avons mangé (We ate)
  - Vous avez mangé (You ate)
  - Ils ont mangé (They ate)

HOWEVER

Imparfait **changes** depending on the subject. For example:

- Je mangeais (I was eating)
- Tu mangeais (You were eating)
- Il mangeait (He was eating)
- Nous mang**ions** (We were eating)
- Vous mang**iez** (You were eating)
- Ils mange**aient** (They were eating)
