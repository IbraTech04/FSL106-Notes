## Complement Object Direct (COD)

COD => Replacing a noun with a pronoun (le, la, les) that is the **direct object** of the verb.

COD answers to the question:
- Qui? (Who?)
- Quoi? (What?)
- Qu'est-ce que? (What PtII)
- **NEVER introduced by a preposition** (à, de, etc.)

> i.e: without a preposition (à, de, etc.)

For example: Je mange **la** pomme (I eat the apple) => Je la mange (I eat it).
Another example: Je mange **les** pommes (I eat the apples) => Je les mange (I eat them).
> Attention! 
> If this was passe compose, we would have to agree with the subject! This is an exception to the rule!
> Example: Il a mangé **la** pomme => Il l'a mangé**e** (Agree with the subject, which in this case is la pomme).

CODs usually get replaced by the pronouns **le, la, les**.

### Examples

*Le chat* mange **la souris**
> Le chat mange quoi? => Le chat mange **la souris**
=> **La souris** is our COD. Linked to the verb **without** a preposition (à, de, etc.).

We say **Manger quelque chose** (to eat something), NOT **Manger à quelque chose**

=> Final sentence with COD: **Le chat** *la* mange (The cat eats *it*).

## Complement Object Indirect (COI)

> Note: ALL communication verbs fall under this category, EXCEPT Appeler (to call). Appeler is NOT COI!!!

Answers tot he question:

- À qui? (To whom?)
- À quoi? (To what?)
- **Always introduced by a preposition** (à, de, etc.) 
    > Recall: au is à + le, aux is à + les. This means they are also COI.

## Where do we put the pronouns?

1. In front of the *simple* verb (present tense, future proche, imperative, etc.)
    > Ex: Je le mange (I eat it)
2. In front of the auxiliary verb (passé composé, plus-que-parfait, futur antérieur, etc.)
    > Ex: Je l'ai mangé (I ate it)
3. In front of the *right* verb (in the case of 2+ verbs in a row), *typically the infinitive*
    > Ex: Je vais le manger (I am going to eat it)
4. BEFORE the verb, **ONLY** in the case of **positive imperative** (i.e: commands).
    > Ex: Mange-le! (Eat it!)
5. Negative imperative is the same as the other tenses.
    > Ex: Ne le mange pas! (Don't eat it!)
