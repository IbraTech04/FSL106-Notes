# Miscellaneous hints

- Recall that `a` and `à` are pronounced the same but are different. `a` is the verb `avoir` conjugated, while `à` is a preposition (at/to).
- WATCH OUT FOR IMPARFAIT!!
  - Recall that we base imparfait on the `nous` form of the verb in present tense; Make sure to include any extra `e`s (ex: naig**e**ait) or c-cédille (ex: commen**ç**ait) in the imparfait form.
  - Recall: It is okay to have a double `i` in imparfait form (in particular, for `re` verbs). For example:
    - étudier: étud**iions** 
- When in doubt, double-n is usually reserved for `ils/elles`, NOT any other form. For example:
  - `ils viennent` vs. `Nous venons` (Single "n" in the `nous` form)

- Exceptions for accords:
  - Reflexive Verbs with a part of body after the verb => NO AGREEMENT
    - ex: Elle s'est lavé les mains (She washed her hands) vs. Elle s'est lavé**e** (She washed herself)
  - Avoir with a COD **before** the verb => AGREEMENT
    - ex: Elle a pris la voiture (She took the car) vs. Elle l'a prise (She took it)

- Recall -GER and -CER verbs have special endings in the `nous` form:
  - -GER => eons (ex: nous mangeons)
  - -CER => çons (ex: nous commençons)
  - Why? Because otherwise it would be pronounced as "g" or "c" (ex: nous mangons, nous commençons). We want to keep the soft "g" and "c" sound.

- Recall: In COD and COI when you *replace* a proper noun with a pronoun, the verb still agrees with the **subject**. Examples:
  - Il a mangé la pomme (He ate the apple) => Il l'a mangée (He ate it)
  - Oui, *nous* vous parl**ons** (Yes, we are talking to you)
  - Oui, *nous* vous invit**ons** (Yes, we are inviting you)
  - Est-ce que vous nous parlez? (Are you talking to us?) => Oui, nous vous parlons (Yes, we are talking to you)

- Recall: In passé composé, the past participle agrees with the subject if the auxiliary verb is **être**. For example:
  - Elle est allée (She went) vs. Ils sont allés (They went)
  - Elle est tombée (She fell) vs. Ils sont tombés (They fell)
  - Elle est partie (She left) vs. Ils sont partis (They left)

> Note that we only have agreements in P.C for avoir iff we use COD, and the COD is before the verb. For example:
> - Elle a mangé la pomme (She ate the apple) => Elle l'a mangée (She ate it)
>   - recall that we are *agreeing* with the Apple here (la pomme), not the subject (elle).

- Coup-de-foudre => Love at first sight

- Recall: 99% of the time, the last letter is *omitted* when pronouncing in French. **This is key for plural vs singular**
  - Example: Elle ven*d* vs Elles Vend*ent*
    - In the first one, the `d` is silent, hence it is pronounced as "ven" (singular)
    - In the second one, the `end` is silent, but the `d` *isn't*. It is pronounced, and therefore you *can* differentiate! 
    - This is the same for many plural forms in French

- Recall: Adorer, Detester, Aimer, and Préférer are all verbs that take the **direct object**. For example:
  - J'adore le chocolat (I love chocolate) vs. Je déteste le chocolat (I hate chocolate)
  - J'aime le chocolat (I like chocolate) vs. Je préfère le chocolat (I prefer chocolate)
  - Always, always, always we use **le** or **la** (the) in front of these verbs, even if we are talking about a general thing. For example:
  - J'adore le chocolat (I love chocolate) vs. Je déteste le chocolat (I hate chocolate)
    - Even tho we would say `Je veux du chocolat`, aimer modifies the meaning and hence is an exception
  - How to remember which verbs: PADA (Préférer, Aimer, Détester, Adorer)

- Recall: `C'est` *usually* requires a pronoun, HOWEVER
  - `C'est` can also be used to refer to a person, in which case it is not required to have a pronoun. For example:
    - C'est mon ami (This is my friend) vs. C'est lui (This is him)
    - C'est Mme. Sima
    - Ce sont M. et Mme Vincent 
  - These all *don't* require pronouns, but they are still correct.

- HOWEVER: `C'EST` + ADJ => MASCULINE, ALWAYS 
    - Ex: C'est beau! C'est Bon! 
    - La tarte c'est delucieux! (The pie is delicious)
      - Always masculine adjective

- NEVER PUT Elle est une etudiante! You do NOT need a pronoun here. 
  - Elle est étudiante (She is a student) vs. C'est une étudiante (This is a student)
  - This is because we are using the verb `être` to describe a person, not to refer to them. 

- Déterminants:
  - Articles
  - Possessive adjectives (ma, mon, mes, etc)
  - Demonstrative adjectives (cette, ces, etc)
