# FSL106 - Ibrahim's Notes 

A collection of notes and resources for FSL106 at the University of Toronto Mississauga.

This is a collection of the notes and review materials I make for myself either during class or before a quiz/midterm to help me study. I figured they might be useful to others as well, so I decided to make them public on GitHub. If you benefit from these notes, please consider starring the repository to show your support!
